## **ROTATION RULES:**

### **Walk-In Policy:**
- Any DJ who shows up gets **30-45 minutes** depending on crowd energy
- First come, first served for open slots
- Priority given to confirmed DJs (Jae5, Smoky, Bomshel)

### **Transition Protocol:**
- Each DJ must **overlap 5-10 minutes** with next DJ for smooth handoff
- If no one is next in line, current DJ **extends their set** until next arrival
- Keep energy building throughout the evening

### **Set Length Guidelines:**
- **30 minutes**: Warm-up sets, walk-ins, transition DJs
- **45 minutes**: Confirmed DJs, peak-time sets (6pm-10pm)
- **60 minutes**: Only if no one else is waiting and crowd is vibing

---

## **PRIORITY CONFIRMED SLOTS:**

1. **Jae5** - 5:45-6:30 PM (or 6:00-7:00 PM if he prefers full hour)
2. **DJ Smoky** - 4:30-5:15 PM (pending confirmation)
3. **DJ Bomshel** - 7:00-7:45 PM OR 8:00-8:45 PM (dialysis dependent)

## **DJ COMMUNICATION - UPDATED MESSAGE:**

Subject: **One Love Jamaica Relief - FLEXIBLE Schedule Nov 22nd** 🇯🇲

Blessings [DJ NAME],

Quick update on the November 22nd Hurricane Melissa Relief event at Mad Oak:

**THIS IS A FLEXIBLE, WALK-IN FORMAT**
- Nobody is locked into rigid times
- Show up when you can, we'll slot you in
- Sets are **30-45 minutes** depending on energy
- **100% volunteer - no payment, just supporting Jamaica**

**Current Rotation Framework:**
- 3:00-4:00 PM: Spotify warm-up
- 4:00-11:00 PM: Rotating DJs (first come, first served for open slots)

**Confirmed Priority Slots:**
- **Jae5**: 5:45-6:30 PM (or 6-7 PM)
- **DJ Smoky**: 4:30-5:15 PM (if available)
- **Bomshel**: 7:00-7:45 PM (dialysis permitting)

If you can make it through for **any amount of time**, we'll work you in. The goal is to keep the vibes going all evening while raising funds for Starlink terminals and emergency supplies for Jamaica.

**Just let me know approximately what time you think you'll arrive**, and we'll have a slot ready for you.

This is about community. This is about showing up. Every 30 minutes of music is another opportunity to raise funds that go directly to helping our people recover.

One Love,
Don

## **BACKUP DJ LIST (from previous event - reference):**

Looking at your Google Sheet reference, here are potential backup DJs if we need to fill slots:

- **Irie Dole** (cancelled but could ask for partial set?)
- **Westafa Cisco** (had multiple slots on previous lineup)
- **Green B** (was on previous lineup)
- **Young Fyah** (had several sets)
- **Fuze** (outdoor stage previous event)
- **Flygerian Jeff** (indoor stage previous event)
- **Rolo/Don Dada** (outdoor stage previous event)

Should I draft a "last minute backup DJ" outreach message to these folks?

**QUESTIONS FOR YOU:**

1. Should Jae5 get 45 minutes (5:45-6:30) or full hour (6:00-7:00)?
2. Do you want me to create a Google Sheet version of this?
3. Should I draft a backup DJ outreach message?
4. Do you want a printable version to post at Mad Oak on the day?

Let me know what adjustments you need!
